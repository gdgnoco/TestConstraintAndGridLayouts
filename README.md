Project demoing ConstraintLayout and GridLayout.

Change layout loaded in MainActivity if you want to see what it looks like on a device or emulator.

layout_bad_cl.xml is and example of when not to use ConstraintLayout.

layout_gl.xml is layout_bad_cl.xml redone using the more appropriate GridLayout

layout_good_c.xml is an example where the use of ConstraintLayout is more appropriate than GridLayout.
Picture the resulting layout as containing an enterprise dashboard app.
